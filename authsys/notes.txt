Why do we create tokens?
It enables users to verify their identity to websites, which then generates a unique encrypted authentication token. That token provides users with access to protected pages and resources for a limited period of time without having to re-enter their username and password.


Now we need to protect certain routes that is we only allow specific users to access certain routes. To do this we write middlewares.
